<h1>The Best Movies According to Chelsea</h1>

  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

    <h3>Dead Poets' Society</h3>

        <p>This was Robin Williams at his best. It's a good reminder to stop taking life so seriously.</p>

    <h3>Matilda</h3>

        <p>I never get tired of watching this movie. It's inspiring, suspenseful, funny, and so quotable.</p>

    <h3>Mean Girls</h3>

        <p>Tina Fey wrote this classic with no anticipation for how huge it would become. For me, Janis was the hero of this movie.</p>
